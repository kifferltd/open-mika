//TODO :
/*
 * 1. Don't forget to write tests for org.apache.harmony.logging.internal.nls/Messages.java this file is in logging/src/main/java folder
 * 2. inrteface filter / LoggingMXBean tests machen
 * 3. XMLFormatter.java should be finish for Monday (not a lot to do) but as I beginn want to finish.  
 * 3. In my case
 *    I didn't use the PARTIAL_OK, so I believe that 98% of COMPLETE are PARTIAL_OK
 *    COMPLETE = Tests finish and should be working. If error check the test before to make a ticket.
 *    PARTIAL = Tests finish, but need special reviewing
 *    TODO = A test to do (or not). Mostly a test to complete
 * 4. For questions christian.wiederseiner
