what to do if you wish interaction with the device component
=============================================================

for the wonka directory
------------------------

* uncomment below comments in config/Defs.make and config/config.arm

  config/Defs.make ( USE THE RIGHT TEST BUNDLE OF YOUR CHOICE !!)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
    #INCLUDELIST += $(DEVICEBOARDINCLUDEDIR) $(DEVICECPUINCLUDEDIR) $(DEVICEINCLUDED

    ...

    # [DV 2000-10-16] uncomment this line if needed
    #ZIPANDJARFILELIST += $(DEVICERELEASEDIR)/device.jar $(DEVICERELEASEDIR)/dummytest.jar

    # comment this line if not needed
    ZIPANDJARFILELIST += $(PYRAMIDRELEASEDIR)/pyramid.jar $(REMRELEASEDIR)/rem.jar

  config/config.arm:
  -------------------
    # [DV 2000-10-18] uncomment this line if needed - device component
    #DEFINEFLAGS += -DDEVICE

    # [DV 2000-10-13] uncomment this line if needed - device component
    #EXTLIBDIRLIST += -L$(DEVICELIBDIR)

    ...

    # [DV 2000-10-13] uncomment this line if needed - device component
    #EXTLIBFILELIST += -l$(DEVICECPULIB)

* adapt jni-classes.in ( dependent of which AWT your building
  	adapt arch/arm/jni-classes.in or wonka/rudolph/jni-classes.in)
	And copy a part of the jni-classes.in file in device directory into the wonka tree
* adapt system.properties 
	the start entry is important ( contains the main method)
	e.g. com.acunia.wonka.Init.<board>.start=org.osgi.impl.framwork.Main
 -init -launch -install device.jar -install <test bundle>.jar -start 1 -start 2


for the device directory
-------------------------

* adapt Makefile, add device subdirectory
	# uncomment this, if needed
	#SUBDIRS += device

still todo
-----------
* solve the with jni-classes.in problem, solution for the moment adapt manual
* solve bootstrap problem with core-classes.in
