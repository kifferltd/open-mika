<TITLE>Wonka Project Goals</TITLE>
<H1>Goals of Project Wonka</H1>
<P>The aim of the project is to create an implementation
of Java<SUP>TM</SUP>, the Open Services Gateway (OSG),
and the Open Telematics Framework,
suitable for use in embedded systems.
This must be a
<A HREF="#complete">complete and correct</A> implementation, 
readily <A HREF="#portable">portable</A> to a wide range of devices,
characterised by a high level of <A HREF="#available">availability</A>,
usable in systems which have <A HREF="#realtime">real-time</A> requirements,
and it must make <A HREF="#efficient">efficient</A> use of limited resources.

<P>Wonka should be the VM of choice for embedding Java in consumer products.
<H2><A NAME="complete">Complete and Correct</A></H2>
<P><B>Everything we claim to implement must be there,
and must work according to spec.</B>
<P>For the VM itself, this means complete adherence to the 
<I>Java<SUP>TM</SUP> Virtual Machine Specification, 2nd Ed.</I>.
For the standard class libraries, the scope is determined by the
<A HREF="./profile.html">published profile</A>
and the functionality by 
<I>The Java<SUP>TM</SUP> Class Libraries, 2nd Ed.</I>.
<P><SMALL>In a few isolated cases, we may diverge from the specification
in order to be "bug-compatible" with Sun's own implementation.
These cases should be documented and kept under review
(it is impossible to tell whether the difference is due to an
undocumented change to the specification or to an error which
will be corrected in the next JDK release).</SMALL>

<H2><A NAME="portable">Portability</A></H2>
<P><B>Keep it clean.</B>
<P>Porting the implementation to a new environment must be a 
straightforward operation, and should result in a high degree
of confidence that the ported version will function correctly.
The keys to portability are <I>well-defined interfaces</I> and
<I>clean code</I>.
<P>The interface to the memory management and scheduling functions
is defined in <CODE>rtos.h</CODE>.
Avoid making direct calls to functions of a 
particular [RT]OS, even "universal" functions such as 
<CODE>malloc()</CODE> or <CODE>free()</CODE>:
on some platforms we might need to make wrapper functions,
e.g. because the standard <code>malloc()</CODE> is not thread-safe.
Interfaces to physical devices must be
isolated either by packaging them in JNI libraries or by using
the Virtual Device Interface defined in <CODE>vdi.h</CODE>.
<P>We only allow the following deviations from ANSI C:
<UL>
<LI>the <CODE>inline</CODE> directive;
<LI>the <CODE>//</CODE> from of comment.
</UL>
<P>The ANS standard allows compilers to implement the standard
data types <CODE>char, int, long,</CODE> etc. in different ways;
therefore the data types <CODE>w_char, w_int</CODE> etc.
should always be used.  We assume that a C pointer
(e.g. <CODE>void *</CODE>) fits into a <CODE>w_word</CODE>,
because this is pretty well hard-wired into the Java language.
Apart from that, nothing should be assumed beyond the letter
of the ANSI standard.  Ill-defined constructs such as bitfields
must be avoided, as must non-standard features or "extensions"
to standard library functions, however seductive.

<H2><A NAME="available">High Availabilty</A></H2>
<P><B>24/7/365/1000</B>
<P>The system should be capable of running "forever", without
degradation of performance.  That means that leakage of memory
or other resources is simply unacceptable, as are "rare" race
conditions or other causes of unpredictable behaviour.  It also
means that data structures and algorithms should be designed to
tend to an acceptable steady state over time, without the need
for major maintenance.

<H2><A NAME="realtime">Real-time Friendly</A></H2>
<P><B>As real-time as its environment allows</B>
<P>We don't really expect the most time-critical parts of an
embedded system to be implemented using Java.  However it must
be possible to use the JVM in systems where there are real-time
requirements, and for subsystems which use Java to have predictable
response times.  Some consequences ot this are:
<UL>
<LI>The Garbage Collector is not allowed to block the system other
than for strictly limited periods.  Blocking includes both locking
access to the heap and running at highest priority.
<LI>When running in an environment which schedules threads strictly
according to their priority, the VM synchronisation operations must 
respect these priorities. The VM must not introduce unwanted
serialisation of actions.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="efficient">Efficient</A></H2>
<P><B>A question of balance</B>
<P>Efficiency is the ratio of output produced to resources consumed.
Time is an important resource, but it is not the only one: 
other resources such as memory and communications bandwidth 
can also be important.  A system can be called efficient when
it succeeds in balancing its use of resources to obtain an 
optimal result.
