Changes in 0.9
--------------

<dl>
<dt>AWT/Rudolph
<dd>Now supports keyboard input from X11 keyboard (ISO 8859-1 only) or the
optional on-screen popup keyboard (European, Katakana, Hirangana).  Output
in Katakana/Hirangana is also possible using the "f12x13ja" fixed-width font.
This work will later be generalised to cover more fonts and writing systems.
<dd>8-bit and 4-bit colour are now supported (the latter on "real" LCD
screens only, not in the X11 emulation).
<dd>Improved conversion from indexed to linear ColorModel, leading to much
faster rendering of indexed-colour images.
<dt>Security &amp; Crypto
<dd>Class java.math.BigInteger, used for cryptographic calculations, 
is now complete.  Added javax.crypto library.
The <a href="http://www.cryptix.org/">Cryptix</a> library runs on Wonka 0.9.
<dd>Basic support for security configuration using <tt>wonka.security</tt>,
<tt>wonka.policy</tt> files.
<dd>As with release 0.8.1, the security code has not yet been subjected to a
full audit, so don't rely on it.
<dt>Command-line interface
<dd>Improved support for options such as -Xmx (e.g. -Xmx=16MB limits heap to
16 MB), -Xbootclasspath.  Default bootclasspath is now 
<tt>/$(BOOTCLASSDIR)/:$(BOOTCLASSDIR)/$(BOOTCLASSFILE)</tt>.
<dd>If no -classpath parameter is given, Wonka will now search for an
environment variable <tt>WONKA_CLASSPAT</tt>H, or failing that <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>.  If
neither are found, the classpath used is <tt>'.'</tt>.
<dd>In connection with these changes, the default name for the file containing
the system classes has changed from <tt>classes.zip</tt> to <tt>wre.jar</tt>.
<dt>VM Internals
<dd>Further reductions in heap usage.
<dt>Work in Progress
<dd>Some aspects of JDWP are working - can suspend/resume threads, examine
local variables.
<dd>Work has begun on implementing RMI.
<dd>The port to eCos is now in a usable state, with AWT support but so far
no networking: see the text and README files in
<a href="http://wonka.acunia.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/open-wonka/kernel/o4e/">
<tt>open-wonka/kernel/o4e</tt></a> for more details.  A port to Win32 is
also underway, but so far works only in text mode.
