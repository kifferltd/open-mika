Changes in 0.9.2
----------------

AWT/Rudolph
  All AWT components now work using peers, providing a better basis for 
  future development and porting. 
  Added Menu classes. Yay! 
  Fixed some annoying glitches in layout managers (negative gaps etc.)
  Taskbar/keyboard made much more configurable - see taskbar.properties file.

VM/Core libraries
  Added a working core of java.rmi - work continues.
  Added functionality to Runtime.exec() and friends.
  Java and native methods now use similar stack frames, making life easier for
