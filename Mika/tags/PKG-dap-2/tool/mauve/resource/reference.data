Falstaff: Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that
are squires of the night's body be called thieves of the day's beauty.
Let us be Diana's foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the
moon; and let men say we be men of good government, being governed, as
the sea is, by our noble and chaste mistress the moon, under whose
countenance we steal.
