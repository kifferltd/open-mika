Changes in 0.8.1
----------------

Configuration stuff:
      Wonka will now read in and interpret the file 
      $ETCDIR/device.config during startup in order to 
      initialize serial ports, mouse etc.  (provided 
      Wonka was built with FICL=true). This should prove 
      more convenient than editing
      wonka/src/driver/linux/comms.c ...
AWT/Rudolph:
      Added an AWT_DEVICE called 'none'. This will compile 
      the AWT, but you don't have any output (screen) or 
      input (mouse/keyboard).  Could be useful for testing
      without X or framebuffer or when porting Wonka to a
      different platform.
      Added keyboard support to most components, and
      beginnings of support for ps/2 mouse.
      Added support for GIF files: this is disabled by
      default. To enable GIF support, recompile Wonka with 
      -sAWT_GIF_SUPPORT=true; note that in order to deply the
      resulting binary you may need a license from Unisys,
      who own a patent on the LZW compression scheme used in 
      many GIF images.
      Added a simple taskbar and popup keyboard for use on
      handhelds.  Extended AWT coverage, e.g. by addition of
      java.awt.Choice.
java.sql/JDBC
      Added basic support.
Unicode
      Added full support for getType() and other Java2 stuff.
Security
      Much of the Java2 framework is now working (work
      continues in HEAD to read and apply policy files, etc.). 
      We have as yet no javax.crypto implementation (that's fit to
      release), but you can try looking at the Cryptix stuff.
      Note that the security code has not yet been subjected to 
      a full review or audit, so don't rely on it!
VM internals
      Many changes aimed at reducing heap usage.
General:
      Added some more README files - README.build,
      README.install, etc..
      The alert reader will note the presence of directories
      "winnt", "o4e", etc.: these contain work-in-progress for 
      porting Wonka to Win32 (and hopefully thus WinCE
      as well as NT) and eCos. If you are interested in
      participating in this work, join the developers' mailing list!
      See also the directory "roadmap", which contains a
      number of text files describing current development ideas.
