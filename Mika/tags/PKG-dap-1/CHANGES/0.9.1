Changes in 0.9.1
----------------

AWT/Rudolph
  Lots of bugfixes and enhancements, particularly in the area of clipping 
  e.g. of partially off-screen components. 
  Event-handling thread now started/re-started when first window is opened, 
  stopped when last window is closed (so Wonka terminates when you would 
  expect). 
  We now have two fonts `nippon13' and `nippon18' which contain haragana and 
  katakana characters. (Kanji is still work-in-progress, sorry). 
  Modal dialogues, e.g. FileDialog. 
  Windows now have a title-bar, which you can use to drag them, wow. 
  We at last have an applet viewer, com.acunia.wonka.AppletViewer, woot woot. 
VM/Core libraries
    Added a lot of classes to cover the OSGi Execution Environment (only 
  one class is still missing, namely java.lang.reflect.Proxy).
        * java.lang.StrictMath (mapped onto java.lang.Math)
        * java.net.HttpURLConnection, java.net.FtpURLConnection (basic 
version)
        * java.security.DomainCombiner
        * java.util.Timer, java.util.TimerTask
        * javax.microedition.io
        * etc.
  Improved shutdown behaviour (cf. AWT event-handling thread). 
  Fixed a lot of serialisation bugs, e.g. by hard-coding SUID.
