( For each device of type sio that you use, you need to specify the path )
( to the device on your platform.                                        )
( attach-serial-device sio 0 /dev/ttyS0   )
( attach-serial-device sio 1 /dev/ttyS1   )
( attach-serial-device sio 2 /dev/ttyS2   )
( attach-serial-device sio 3 /dev/ttyS3  )

( Each register-serial-device command takes three parameters: the name of )
( the device, the "family" name of its driver, and a member number.       )

( Register serial devices - remove the brackets round the ones you need. )
( register-serial-device  sio0   sio  0 )
( register-serial-device  sio1   sio  1 )
( register-serial-device  sio2   sio  2 )
( register-serial-device  sio3   sio  3 )

( Specify the mouse driver and path.  Currently the first two parameters )
( are ignored. Only effective for framebuffer devices, not for X.        )
