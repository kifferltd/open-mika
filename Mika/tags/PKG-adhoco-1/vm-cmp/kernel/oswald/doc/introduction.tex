\section{Why Another Operating System}

There are several good reasons for making our own operating system:

\begin{itemize}
\item Porting the OS to another processor is relatively easy since we know
all the insides and out-sides. Only 3 assembly functions are required:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \txt{x\_init\_stack}: an assembly function that sets up the stack of
a thread that is being created.
\item \txt{x\_thread\_switch}: an assembly function that will switch
between different threads; the current thread stack and status is saved and the thread
that should run next is reinstated.
\item \txt{x\_start\_init}: an assembly function that will start off the
initial thread of the kernel. All other threads are started by means of a
call to \txt{x\_thread\_switch}.
\end{enumerate}

\item Porting the OS to another processor is done by our own company; this
means that the porting effort, which is an element of the critical path of
development is in our own hands.
\item There are no external royalties to be payed to the OS vendor.
\item Implementing special features like the combination of real time
threads with round robin threads is relatively easy.
\item Integration with our hardware is almost perfect. Extra features that
need hardware support and vice versa can be implemented without the need to
rely on an outside party.
\item Code bloat can be kept to a minimum and is under our own control.
\item And probably the most important element is that Oswald is tailor fit for
Wonka, the Java Virtual Kernel. Any feature that is required by Wonka, can
be implemented in Oswald; awe full, isn't it...
\end{itemize}

There are also some things to say against writing yet another operating
system:

\begin{itemize}
\item Writing a solid real time kernel is a daunting task.
\item Porting to another processor requires extra internal resources.
\item And so forth
\end{itemize}
