Changes in 0.7.2
----------------

Configuration stuff:
  New config variables BUILDROOT and FSROOT: the former specifies where
  files should be put on the build machine, the latter specifies (for
  FILESYSTEM=native only) where Wonka will look for them on the target.
  Useful for cross-compilation!
  New config variables BOOTCLASSDIR and BOOTCLASSFILE tell the 
  bootstrap class loader where to look for classes.zip (or whatever
  you choose to call it).
  New variable DUMPFILE determines where woempa's will be logged
  (useful if e.g. FSROOT is / or /usr/local/share/wonka).
VM (Wonka):
  Fixed a major problem with GC: finalizable objects were not completing
  their life-cycle properly, so not getting garbage-collected.
  New code for handling constant pool, reducing memory consumption and
  fragmentation.
AWT (Rudolph):
  A good deal of refactoring which should improve performance and stability.
  Most noticeable improvements are in the areas of scrollbars, checkboxes,
  and buttons (which no longer stay pressed when they shouldn't).
RTOS (OSwald):
  Made a start on a native exception handling system: see
  open-wonka/kernel/oswald/tests/exception_test.c for more info.
  Not yet used by Wonka.
Miscellaneous:
  The following command-line switches are now implemented and act as
  expected (?):
    -classpath/-cp, -D, -Xbootclasspath, -version, -help, -X,-?
  
  Work has begun on implementing 'Java Platform Debugger Interface' (JPDA)
  and 'Java Debug Wire Protocol' (JDWP).  See open-wonka/jdpa.
  The adaptive compiler (code-named `J-spot') is beginning to take shape:
  see directory open-wonka/compiler-jspot.
