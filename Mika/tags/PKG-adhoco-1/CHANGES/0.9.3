Changes in 0.9.3
----------------

AWT/Rudolph
 - Greatly improved implementation of java.awt.List. 
 - Overall drawing speed improved by smarter copying routines.
 - Added support for animated GIFs.
 - Many cosmetic improvements.
Core libraries
 - Thread.sleep/join are now mapped directly to their OSwald equivalents.
 - All exisiting classes in java.io are now 1.3 compliant.
 - java.io.InputStreamReader now implements all "mandatory" encodings
   (ASCII, UTF8, various UTF16's).
 - New improved System.arraycopy().
 - Shutdown hooks now work (and will be called on SIGTERM/SIGINT).
 - Unicode support can be reduced if required, resulting in a smaller
   unicode.c file.
 - Several improvements in JarFIle/ZipFIle classes.
VM
 - New interpreter resulting in >50% speed increase.
 - If a string uses only ISO 8859-1 characters, use only 8 bits/char to 
   store it.  (Other strings still use 16 bits/char).
 - Fixed some nasty race conditions etc..
OSwald
 - Scheduler improvements relating in greater perceived responsiveness.
 - OSwald can now optionally export x_mem_alloc etc. as malloc etc..
 - OSwald will now grab memory from Linux as required, instead of one big
   malloc of 50MB (or whatever) at the start. Will also retrun memory if 
   heap usage falls.
