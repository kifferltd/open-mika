Changes in 0.9.4
----------------

Platforms
  Wonka now runs on NetBSD (arm, i386) as well as Linux.  Thanks to Nick
  Hudson of the NetBSD team for making this happen.  Currently only
  kernel/oswald  and awt_device=xsim are supported.

AWT/Rudolph
 - Alejandro L. Ibarra submitted a patch for 8-bit (RRGGBB) framebuffer.
   To use it set -sAWT_PIXELFORMAT=c332 at build time (default is c565).
 - Transparent and animated GIFs, and PNG trasparency, are now supported.
 - Can run with AWT_MOUSE=none (thanks to Michael Smith).
 - Further peerification (Button, Label, Checkbox).
 - Can now read in pcf fonts from disk and render them. Currently working
   with a hard-coded list of fonts, will work using a configuration file
   in the near future. For now look in Font.java, Font.c, wonka/resource/
   system/font to get an idea of what's available.
Core libraries
 - java.io should now implement complete 1.3 API. Work continues with other
   packages (especially those of OSGi RFC 26).
 - All "mandatory" encodings (US-ASCII, ISO 8859-1, UTF8, UTF16) are now
   supported everywhere.
 - Many performance improvements, especially aimed at improving startup
   time (initial class loading etc.).
 - Serialization/deserialization completely re-written, should be faster
   and more correct.
 - A number of fixes contributed by Mark Anderson.
Miscellaneous
 - Added support for the -jar command line switch.
