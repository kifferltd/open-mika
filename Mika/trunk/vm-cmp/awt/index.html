<TITLE>Open Wonka: directory open-wonka/awt</TITLE>

<H1>Directory <tt>open-wonka/awt</tt></H1>

<p>Apart from the ubiquitous <a href="Jamfile">Jamfile</a>,
this directory has two subdirectories:
<dl>
<dt><a href="none/">none</a>
<dd>The "null" AWT implementation, which contains only stubs required
to fulfill external references (java.awt.AWTPermission and init_awt).
<dt><a href="rudolph/">rudolph</a>
<dd>Rudolph<sup>(TM)</sup>, a lightweight AWT designed to work with
a framebuffer device: however it can also work with an X window
simulating a framebuffer, or with no device at all (enabling methods
of the AWT to be used on headless systems).
</dl>

<p>One or other directory will be included in the build according
to the setting of the <tt>AWT</tt> variable (<tt>-sAWT=rudolph</tt>
or <tt>-sAWT=none</tt>).  For <tt>-sAWT=rudolph</tt> the output
device can be selected by setting <tt>-sAWT_DEVICE=fdev</tt>,
<tt>-sAWT_DEVICE=xsim</tt>, or <tt>-sAWT_DEVICE=none</tt>.
