<TITLE>Open Wonka: directory open-wonka/network</TITLE>

<H1>Directory <tt>open-wonka/network</tt></H1>

<p>Apart from the ubiquitous <a href="Jamfile">Jamfile</a>,
this directory has two subdirectories:
<dl>
<dt><a href="native/">native</a>
<dd>The "native" netwoek implementation, which translates all socket
operations to operations on the underlying BSD sockets interface
of the host OS
<dt><a href="none/">none</a>
<dd>A dummy implementation in which all socket calls simply fail. 
</dl>

<p>One or other directory will be included in the build according
to the setting of the <tt>NETWORK</tt> variable (<tt>-sNETWORK=native</tt>
or <tt>-sNETWORK=none</tt>).
