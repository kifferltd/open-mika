\section{Programming Interfaces}

\subsection{Conventions}

The programming interfaces for \oswald are designed to be simple, intuitive,
consistent and small in number. Each function call in \oswald starts with the
\txt{'x\_'}. The next word is the element to which the call refers, again
followed by an underscore and then a description of what the function does
with the element. This description has been carefully chosen so that it can
be used consistently for other elements, where applicable; E.g.

\txt{x\_status x\_mailbox\_send(x\_mailbox mailbox, word * data, x\_sleep timeout);}

\txt{x\_status x\_queue\_send(x\_queue, word * data, x\_sleep timeout);}

The first function describes how to send a message to a mailbox, while the
second is trying to send a message to a queue.

\subsection{Structure Fields}

For each element that can be used in \oswald, e.g. mutexes, semaphores, ... the
fields of the structure will be explained shortly. A programmer is allowed
to look at these fields, but \textbf{should not} be tempted to change any of
these fields.

Another important note is that \oswald will update these fields internally in
a controlled way; therefore reading of these fields by a thread can give an
indication of its value but it is never guaranteed to another thread is
changing or has changed the field so that it's value is not constent
anymore.

In other words, a programmer can decide to read the fields and take
according action, but must always assume that the fields value could
have changed allready and must therefore accommodate for such changes.

For example, before locking a mutex, a programmer can decide to peek at the
field \txt{x\_mutex$\rightarrow$owner} and see that it is NULL. He can
not assume that the mutex is unlocked, since the \txt{owner} field of the
mutex could have been changed allready. If it is not NULL, she may neither
assume that the mutex is locked by the thread indicated by the
\txt{x\_mutex$\rightarrow$owner} field. The only thing that can be
deduced is that the thread indicated by this field \textbf{has} locked the mutex in
the past and \textbf{could} very well be the current owner.

Note that the fields in the structure that can be changed by different
threads, have the qualifier \txt{volatile} to prevent the compiler of
optimizing away possibly changing values, as constant values. In other
words, fields that don't have the \txt{volatile} qualifier, will not be
changed by different threads and can be treated as constants during the
lifetime of the event.

\subsection{Return Values}

The API is consistent also in the return values. Most functions in \oswald return
an \txt{x\_status} enumeration. When the call succeeds, this is always the
same value of \txt{xs\_success}, whatever the element the call was tried on.

This implies that all data that is to be changed by a called function, is to
be passed as a pointer.

The generic meaning of the return values and the situation where they can occur are summarized 
in table \ref{table:xstatus}.

\hline
\textbf{Status} & \textbf{Returned by} & \textbf{Meaning} \\ \hline
\endhead
\hline
\endfoot
\endlastfoot
\txt{xs\_success} &

All functions. &

\begin{minipage}[t]{7.5cm}
When an operation succeeds, this is the returned status.
\end{minipage} \\
 & & \\

\txt{xs\_no\_instance} &

\begin{minipage}[t]{3.5cm}
All functions that try to set or try to get something, or functions that try
to achieve an operation being done, mostly in with the constraint of a
timing window during which the operation can be tried.
\end{minipage} &

\begin{minipage}[t]{7.5cm}
When the specified operation did not succeed within the given time frame,
this is the status that is returned, or when the specified operation did not
perform the operation. For more specific information, we refer to the status
return values of each operation.
\end{minipage} \\

 & & \\

\txt{xs\_bad\_context} &

\begin{minipage}[t]{3.5cm}
All functions that take a time out value during which the operation is
tried.
\end{minipage} &

\begin{minipage}[t]{7.5cm}
When the operation was tried from an interrupt or timer (not
yet implemented) and the given timeout value was not \txt{x\_no\_wait}, this is
the returned status. Interrupt handlers or timer handler functions should
not become suspended, therefore the only timing argument allowed is
\txt{x\_no\_wait}.
\end{minipage} \\

 & & \\

\txt{xs\_not\_owner} &

\begin{minipage}[t]{3.5cm}
\txt{x\_mutex\_unlock} 
\txt{x\_mutex\_delete} 
\txt{x\_monitor\_exit} 
\txt{x\_monitor\_delete} 
\txt{x\_monitor\_notify} 
\txt{x\_monitor\_wait} 
\end{minipage} &

\begin{minipage}[t]{7.5cm}
When the thread tries to unlock or delete a mutex or monitor that it doesn't own, this is the
returned status.
\end{minipage} \\

 & & \\

\txt{xs\_deadlock} &

\txt{x\_mutex\_lock} &

\begin{minipage}[t]{7.5cm}
When the thread tries to lock a mutex that it owns already, this is the
returned status. Monitors in \oswald can be locked multiple times by a
thread. No deadlock can appear on monitors.
\end{minipage} \\

 & & \\

\txt{xs\_bad\_option} &

\begin{minipage}[t]{3.5cm}
\txt{x\_signals\_put} \\
\txt{x\_signals\_get} 
\end{minipage} &

\begin{minipage}[t]{7.5cm}
When the option given to any signals get or set operation does not apply to
the given situation, this is the returned status. More information can be
found in the section on signals.\\
\end{minipage} \\

 & & \\

\txt{xs\_deleted} &

\begin{minipage}[t]{3.5cm}
All operations on events (mutexes, monitors, signals, maps, block,
semaphores, queues).
\end{minipage} &

\begin{minipage}[t]{7.5cm}
When the event structure was deleted when some threads were trying an
operation on it, this is the status that is returned to the waiting threads.
Note that this nearly always means bad programming! The programmer should
treat this as an error and should fix it before releasing the software.
\end{minipage} \\

 & & \\

\txt{xs\_waiting} &

\begin{minipage}[t]{3.5cm}
When the structure was deleted when some threads were still waiting, this is the
status that is returned to the waiting threads.
\end{minipage} &

\begin{minipage}[t]{7.5cm}
When the structure was deleted and some threads where waiting on it, the
caller that deletes the structure will get this status returned.
Note that this nearly always means bad programming! The programmer should
treat this as an error and should fix it before releasing the software.

\subsection{Timeout Values}

Several \oswald functions take a timeout parameter. This is a value that
specifies a timing window during which the operating system will try to
succeed in the requested operation. 

The type of the timeout value is \txt{x\_sleep} or \txt{x\_window},
both types are synonyms. The timeout type is
unsigned. There are however 2 very special timeout values,
\txt{x\_eternal} indicates that \oswald should try for an indefinite
amount of time to try the operation, while the \txt{x\_no\_wait} value
indicates that the operation system should just try the operation and return
immediately, whether it was successful or not.

Note that for timer handler functions and interrupt handlers,
\txt{x\_no\_wait} is the only valid timeout option.

For consistency, this timeout value is always passed as the last argument to
a function call, where applicable.
