<TITLE>Open Wonka: directory open-wonka/awt</TITLE>

<H1>Directory <tt>open-wonka/awt</tt></H1>

<p>Apart from the ubiquitous <a href="Jamfile">Jamfile</a>,
this directory has three subdirectories:
<dl>
<dt><a href="oswald/">oswald</a>
<dd>The Reference Implementation of OSwald, an RTOS which can run either
on bare hardware or as a "guest" of another operating system.
<dt><a href="o4e/">o4e</a>
<dd>An implementation of the OSwald API in terms of the threading and memory
management primitives of eCos, the Embedded Configurable Operating System
from RedHat.
<dt><a href="o4p/">o4p</a>
<dd>An implementation of the OSwald API in terms of "pthreads", the threading
operations defined by POSIX, and malloc/free.
<dt><a href="o4w/">o4w</a>
<dd>An implementation of the OSwald API in terms of the threading and memory
management primitives of the Win32 API.
</dl>

<p>One or other directory will be included in the build according
to the setting of the <tt>SCHEDULER</tt> variable (<tt>-sSCHEDULER=oswald</tt>,
<tt>-sSCHEDULER=o4e</tt> or <tt>-sSCHEDULER=o4p</tt>).
