<TITLE>Open Wonka: directory open-wonka/fs</TITLE>

<H1>Directory <tt>open-wonka/fs</tt></H1>

<p>Apart from the ubiquitous <a href="Jamfile">Jamfile</a>,
this directory has two subdirectories:
<dl>
<dt><a href="native/">native</a>
<dd>The "native" filesystem implementation, which translates all filesystem
operations to operations on the underlying (POSIX-compliant) filesystem
of the host OS
<dt><a href="vfs/">vfs</a>
<dd>The "vfs" filesystem implementation, which in fact implements 
<tt>e2fs</tt> on a raw block device.
</dl>

<p>Yes, these names are somewhat misleading. :{

<p>One or other directory will be included in the build according
to the setting of the <tt>FILESYSTEM</tt> variable (<tt>-sFILESYSTEM=native</tt>
or <tt>-sFILESYSTEM=vfs</tt>).

<p>The alert reader will be wondering why there is no subdirectory 
<tt>none</tt>.  That's because <tt>-sFILESYSTEM=none</tt> doesn't work ...
