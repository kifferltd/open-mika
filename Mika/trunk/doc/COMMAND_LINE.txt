The mika commandline
====================

Usage: mika [-options] [class [args...]]
                                If Mika is started without a class, a default class is used.
                                The default class can be changed in mika.properties.
 options:
   -cp -classpath <classpath>   set search path for classes and resources
   -D<name>=<value>             set a system property
   -version                     print version
   -? -help --help              print this explanation
   -X                           print help on non-standard options
   -W                           print help on Mika specific options



Work in progress ...
