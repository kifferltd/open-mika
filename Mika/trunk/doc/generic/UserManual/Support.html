<h2>Bug Reporting and Support</h2>

<p>If you have questions about using Mika, or if you believe you have
found a bug in the VM or class libraries, send a message to the A9Mxxxx 
newsgroup (e.g. via <a href=http://www.unc20.net>www.unc20.net</a>).
Post your message as the start of a new thread (not a follow-up to an
existing thread), and ensure that the title begins with "JAVA:".

<p>/k/ Embedded Java Solutions will follow the newsgroup on a regular basis,
but we cannot guarantee to solve your problem nor to respond
within a given time. If Mika is important to your product development then
we strongly suggest you take out a support contract: see the web site
(<a href="http://www.kiffer.be/k/mika/">www.kiffer.be/k/mika</a>)
for more details.

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<p>There are a few known problems with this release of the Mika class libraries;
these will be fixed in a future release.
Contact /k/ Embedded Java Solutions if you have an urgent requirement for the
missing functionality.
