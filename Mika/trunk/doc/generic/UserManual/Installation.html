<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Installing the Jikes Compiler (optional)</h3>

<p>If you do not currently have any kind of Java development installed, you
will need to install at least a Java compiler. We recommend Jikes, an open 
source Java compiler developed by IBM.  You can find Jikes in the <tt>Jikes</tt>
directory of the cd, or on the web site at
<a href=http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/>http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/</a>.
<p>Jikes is just a Java compiler, not a complete developement environment.
However it can be used in conjunction with the <tt>Makefile</tt>s supplied as 
part of the Mika distribution to provide a command-line based environment
which is perfectly adequate for small projects.
<p>See the chapter <a href=Project.html>Building a Project</a>
for more information on building projects using Jikes and <tt>make</tt>.

<h3>Installing the Mika binaries</h3>

<p>The simplest method is to <t>cd</tt> to the CD and run the <tt>install.sh</tt>
script, e.g.
<pre>
    cd /mnt/cdrom
    ./install.sh
</pre>

<p>This will create a directory <tt>/targets/Mika</tt>, 
containing the Mika executable for arm7tdmi/uClinux (<tt>mika</tt>)
and directories for the Mika runtime environment
(<tt>fsroot/</tt>) and applications (<tt>apps/</tt>).

<p>Of course you can also place the <tt>Mika</tt> directory in your home directory,
or even in somewhere like <tt>/usr/local/shared/</tt>.  (Note that you
will need to have write access to the Mika directory and its subdirectories
when you build projects.) In this case you should copy the contents of the CD
onto your hard disc and make the appropriate changes to the <tt>install.sh</tt>
script before running it.

<p>The <tt>Mika/</tt> directory contains files <tt>COPYRIGHT</tt> and 
<tt>COPYRIGHT.Wonka</tt> which you should read carefully.

<h3>Creating a target directory</h3>

<p>For ease of debugging, we recommend that you create an NFS export on your
development host which can be mounted by the A9Mxxxx.  See chapter 5.4,
<cite>Configuring the Network on the Host</cite> of the LxNETES User's Manual
for details. The <tt>Makefile</tt>s supplied with Mika are set up to place
the Mika binary, libraries and applications in directory
<tt>$LXNETES_NFSROOT_</tt><i>&lt;project&gt;</i><tt>/Mika</tt>, where
<i>&lt;project&gt;</i> is the project name as indicated by environment
variable <tt>$LXNETES_PROJECT</tt>; thus if <tt>$LXNETES_PROJECT</tt> holds
<tt>/targets/LxNETES/project_foo</tt> the directory
<tt>$LXNETES_NFSROOT_project_foo/Mika</tt>
will be used. (See also chapter 5.5, <cite>Environment variables</cite> of the LxNETES User's Manual.)

<p>You may also wish to create a subdirectory
<tt>$LXNETES_NFSROOT_</tt><i>&lt;project&gt;</i>/Mika/data</tt> which is
writable by the A9Mxxxx (in practice this may mean making it world-writable,
depending on your NFS configuration).
