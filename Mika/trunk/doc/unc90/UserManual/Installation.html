<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Copyright notice<h3>

<p>The CD contains files <tt>COPYRIGHT</tt> and 
<tt>COPYRIGHT.Wonka</tt> which you should read carefully.

<h3>Installing the Jikes Compiler (optional)</h3>

<p>If you do not currently have any kind of Java development installed, you
will need to install at least a Java compiler. We recommend Jikes, an open 
source Java compiler developed by IBM.  You can find Jikes 
on the SourceForge web site at
<a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/jikes/>http://sourceforge.net/projects/jikes/</a>; 
Debian users can also install the 'jikes' package 
(<tt>apt-get install jikes</tt>).
<p>Jikes is just a Java compiler, not a complete developement environment.
However it can be used in conjunction with the <tt>Makefile</tt>s supplied as 
part of the Mika distribution to provide a command-line based environment
which is perfectly adequate for small projects.
<p>See the chapter <a href=Project.html>Building a Project</a>
for more information on building projects using Jikes and <tt>make</tt>.

<h3>Installing the Mika environment</h3>

<p>In your project directory, run the <tt>install.sh</tt> script on the CD; e.g.
<pre>
cd &#126;/LxNETES-3.2/myproject/
/cdrom/install.sh
</tt>
</pre>

<p>This will install the Mika binary in subdirectory
<tt>rootfs_wo_kernel/usr/bin/</tt>,
the Mika libraries in subdirectory <tt>rootfs_wo_kernel/usr/lib/mika/</tt>,
and the sample makefiles in subdirectory <tt>java-apps</tt>
of the project directory.

<h3>Completing installation</h3>

<p>After performing these steps you can proceed to the <tt>make</tt> and
<tt>make&nbsp;install</tt> steps of the kernel installation. To test the correct
functioning of 
<font color="#cc0000"><b>Mi</b>|<b>k</b>|<b>a</b></font>, 
try running the command:
<pre>mika HelloWorld</tt>
</pre>
