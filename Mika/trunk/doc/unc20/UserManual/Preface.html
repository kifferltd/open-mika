<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>The UNC20 Development Kit for Java provides a complete solution for executing
Java2<sup><small>TM</small></sup> programs on the UNC20 development system supplied by
FS Forth-Systeme GmbH. This document explains how to use the Development Kit
to develop and test Java applications for the UNC20.

<p>It is assumed that you have access to a UNC20 Development Kit and
accompanying documentation, and that you are familiar with the basics
of writing and compiling Java programs. You will also need to be able to
perform basic Unix/Linux administration tasks such as creating a directory 
or a symbolic link.
