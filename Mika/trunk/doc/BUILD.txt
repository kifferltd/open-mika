Building Mika
=============

Building mika is done by calling ant in the top directory of your source tree.
If you are not familiar with ant, consult the documentation at 'http://ant.apache.org'.

There are 5 tasks which can be called directly with ant:

1. main: this is the main build task. This is also the default task run by ant.
   Typing ant in this directory is actually the same as ant main. However just typing
   ant will fail since the build wants to know what platform you intend to build for.
   To specify the platform, you must define a parameter (property) called PLATFORM.
   Passing properties to ant goes with -D option. So, let's keep it easy and build for pc.
   You're commandline would look like: 'ant -DPLATFORM=pc' or 'ant -DPLATFORM=pc main'.
   Ant will now compile and package mika. You can build mika for another platform by
   calling 'ant -DPLATFORM=otherplatform' or for multiple platforms in one call:
   'ant -DPLATFORM=platform1,platform2,...'

2. clean: clean will clean all generated files from a specific build. Example:
   'ant -DPLATFORM=pc' will delete all files generated specifically for the pc build.

3. cleanall: as it says, cleanall will delete all generated files (no need to specify
   a PLATFORM here). 'ant cleanall' will do.

4. sample: this target will compile and package all the samples.

5. tests: the 'tests' target  will build the VisualTestEngine, the ApletViewer
   and the mauve-test. More details on these test can be found in doc/TESTS.txt.


Customizing your build
----------------------

As you can see sometimes (task 1 and 2) you need to specify a platform. A valid PLATFORM points to 
a file with the same name in Configuration/ant. These files define ant configuration for
specific setups and are used for building mika (the clean can offcourse live without that configuration). 
They should contains at least the following properties:
SECURITY, JAR, MATH, JAVA_BEANS, AWT, DEBUG, JAVAX_CRYPTO, JAVAX_COMM, AWT_DEF, 
STATIC, JAM.PLATFORM, JAVA_DEBUG and UNICODE_SUBSETS. If you read the TREE-LAYOUT.txt, you'll 
notice that most of these properties map onto an extension, vm-extension or -component.
For vm- and reguler extensions (JAVA_BEANS, JAVAX_CRYPTO, JAVAX_COMM and MICRO_IO) the value 
is true or false. For the vm-components (SECURITY, JAR,MATH and AWT) the value is one of the
components as mentioned in TREE-LAYOUT.txt.

The other properties are:
* AWT_DEF: values: a file in Configuration/awt. This should only be defined when AWT is rudolph.
  It will define extra JAM settings.
* UNICODE_SUBSETS: defines which unicode subsets to include.
  By default code will be generated in unicode.c to cover only ISO 8859-1.
  Specify a colon-separated list of subset numbers to extend Unicode coverage
  to one or more subsets of Unicode: see tool/script/unicode.awk for details.
  Specify 999 to get complete Unicode coverage.  Characters from non-included
  subsets will be treated by Mika as undefined.
* JAVA_DEBUG: whether to compile the core vm-classes with debug.
* JAM.PLATFORM: should point to a file in Configuration/platform. It contains the settings 
  for jam.
* STATIC: values: true or false. Switches between static or dynamic linking. 
* DEBUG: values: true or false. It enables the native debug.

All of the mentioned properties can of course be specified on your commandline.
By adding '-DAWT=none' for instance, you select the 'none' AWT implementation. Parameters
passed on the command line take precedence over those in the configuration file.


Jamming mika
------------

Despate all the nice features ant has, it not suited well to compile and link native libraries/binaries.
Currently 'jam' is being used as build tool for the native parts. Until recently we had custom jam
version (the acunia-jam) to build the whole of mika but any version should do. For instance FT-Jam (or freetype jam).

The configuration for jam is a bit less easy then the ant one. 'jam' will start of reading the configartion
file defined by JAM.PLATFORM. It will take the file with same name in the Configuration/platform directory.
The platform definition should/will define a CPU and HOSTOS. These values are used to find and read files in
Configuration/cpu and Configuration/host. These files define the toolchain to use and extra compilerflags.
The last step is to read the Configuration/wonka/default file. When selecting AWT=rudolph the jam build will also
read (or at least try to read) the file defined by AWT_DEF from the directory Configuration/awt.
When defining TOOL_CONFIG, jam will also read that file from Configuration/tool. When defined this file will be read
as the last one in the chain. Take note: Jam allows previously defined settings to be overriden. 
To find a out which properties are available and what they mean, please read Configuration/wonka/default.

As mention earlier, both the STATIC and DEBUG flag are not used by ant by only passed to the jam commandline. In general
all properties added to the ant command (using -D) which start with JAM.xxx=yyy will be passed to jam as
-sxxx=yyy. So specifying -DJAM.DEBUG=true would do the same as -DDEBUG=true, but it could confuse the build if
you start using both. But keep in mind that if one of the configurations file also defines a commandline one, 
it will be overriden.


Building mika for your platform
------------------------------- 

There are a few basic configurations available for both ant and jam.  To make a
build for your embedded platform, we recommend that you take one of the existing
configurations which quite closely resembles your target and derive your own version.
cd Configuration/ant/
cp arm-linux mytarget
vi mytarget

You will probably want to do the same at the Configuration/platform level in order
to adjust compiler flags etc..  Don't forget to change the JAM.PLATFORM line in the
Configuration/ant file so that it links to the one in Configuration/platform.
The "default" files document the various build-time variables, but we recommend 
that you do not edit these files directly - all your changes should be in your own
files.  That way it is much easier to keep track of which things you have changed and
which you haven't.
