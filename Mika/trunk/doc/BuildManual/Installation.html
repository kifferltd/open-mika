<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The following description assumes that the UNC20 Development Kit for Java
has already been installed, so install it now if you didn't do so already.

<h3>Installing the Acunia tools</h3>

<p>The <tt>acunia-jam</tt> and <tt>jamjar</tt> tools are included on the CD
in directory <tt>tools/Acunia/bin</tt>. To install them simply copy the 
executable to some directory in your <tt>PATH</tt>, e.g. an existing directory
such as <tt>/usr/bin</tt> or one you create specially for the purpose.
(Note that you will need to become root to install in <tt>/usr/bin</tt>).

<h3>Installing the Mika source tree</h3>

<p>The Mika source tree can be installed anywhere you like, e.g. under your
home directory or in a shared directory such as <tt>/targets/LxNETES/project_unc20</tt>.
No use is made of symbolic links or other tricky stuff, so any means of copying
is good: <tt>cp -r</tt>, <tt>tar</tt>, or drag-and-drop in your favourite GUI.

<p>The <tt>Mika/</tt> directory contains files <tt>COPYRIGHT</tt> and 
<tt>COPYRIGHT.Wonka</tt> which you should read carefully.

<h3>Using a Java compiler other than Jikes</h3>

<p>If you decide not to use the Jikes compiler, you will need to overrule
the default settings in the top-level <tt>Jamrules</tt>. In theory you could
do this by typing e.g.
<pre>
-sJAVAC=javac
</pre>
each time you invoke <tt>acunia-jam</tt>, but in practice it is probably 
easier to open <tt>Mika-source/Jamrules</tt> in a text editor and change the line
<pre>
JAVAC default = jikes ;
</pre>
to select your preferred Java compiler.

<p>Note that the Mika class libraries represent a large and complex project,
and some compilers may produce incorrect bytecode for some components.
Therefore we recommend sticking to the version of Jikes supplied as part of
the UNC20 Development Kit for Java.
