<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>The UNC20 Development Kit for Java provides a complete solution for executing
Java2<sup><small>TM</small></sup> programs on the UNC20 development system
supplied by FS Forth-Systeme GmbH. This document explains how to use the 
Source Code Kit to build a custom VM and Java libraries for the UNC20.

<p>It is assumed that you have access to a UNC20 Development Kit and
UNC20 Development Kit for Java and accompanying documentation, 
and that you are familiar with the basics of writing and compiling C and Java 
programs using a command-line environment. You will also need to be able to
perform basic Unix/Linux administration tasks such as creating a directory 
or a symbolic link. 

<p>The information contained in this manual relate to version 1.1.1 of 
<font color=#cc0000><b>Mi</b>|<b>k</b>|<b>a</b></font>
for UNC20. As 
<font color=#cc0000><b>Mi</b>|<b>k</b>|<b>a</b></font>
is continuously improved, details of the build process may change in subsequent
releases. Make sure that the documentation you are using corresponds to the
version of the build tree you have (see the VERSION file).
