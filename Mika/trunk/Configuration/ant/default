# This file should be formatted as a valid java.properties file.

#
# If you are building Mika for your target, don't change the settings here:
# create your own Configuration/ant/foo file and do it there instead.

#
# Define your Jam configuration. A file with the same name
# should be found in Configuration/platform
#
JAM.PLATFORM=pc

#
# Choose an awt implementation: either rudolph or none
# When selecting rudolph also select an AWT_DEF.
# valid options for AWT_DEF are xsim and fdev
#
AWT=none
#AWT_DEF=xsim

#
# Define your security level: either java2 or none.
# If java2 is selected, a jarfile verification implementation must be selected
# (JAR!=none)).
#
SECURITY=none

#
# Define your security provider: currently either harmony or none.
# Note that it can make sense to have a security provider even when SECURITY
# is set to 'none', for example in order to be able to perform encryption.
#
SECURITY_PROVIDER=harmony

#
# Allows you to enable jarfile verification.
# none: no jar verification
# java: jarfile verification is done in java
#       In this case a SECURITY_PROVIDER must be specified.

JAR=java

#
# Defines how some of the java.lang.Math methods are handled.
# Either native or java.
#
MATH=java

#
# The following packages are optional. If you don't need them
# you can leave them out. 'true = in' and false means no such

# expect for micro_io, that's a jar on it's own.

# enables debug information in the java classes (this values is passed to

# Specify a colon-separated list of subset numbers to extend Unicode coverage

# Specify 999 to get complete Unicode coverage.  Characters from non-included
