this directory contains everything we need to test wonka.

this contains: the mauve tree starts with directory gnu

gnu/testlet/ in this you can find the currnet framework used to test wonka
gnu/testlet/wonka/ here are the testfiles grouped by package 

Each class which has existing tests will have a subdirectory (in its package)
where all files are collected.

Take note: the mauve frame has a class Mv_Assert.  This class is  used to
transform the JUnit test to Mauve. read MauveUnitDoc.sdw (staroffice format)
a comparison between Mauve and Junit can be found in
Junit_and_Mauve_testing.sdw (both files are in subdir documents)

the file wonkatest.wn contains the list of files which will be executed by
the TestRunner.

in the directory documents we can put usefull information about testing.

the directory extrasourcecode contains sourcecode which should not be
compiled, but is usefull to have in CVS.
we have for now:
===> framework: here is a full version of the Mauveframework --> writting to
a file is not yet possible in wonka.  this frame writes results in a file
===> wonkadoc: sourcecode to add flag tested in javadoc report
