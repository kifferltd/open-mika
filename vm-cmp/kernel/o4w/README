README File for o4w
===================

o4w is a mapping of most functions of the Oswald API on Windows.
We have ported those functions that wonka needs for running.



BUILDING O4W
============

You can build the o4w library and the tests using the jam tool,
Microsoft Visual C++ and Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++.

Jam:	use the following command line options
	-sSCHEDULER=o4w -sHOSTOS=winnt

Visual c++:	this will compile for running under Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000 and XP
		just open the workspace file in the root directory of open-wonka (.dsw)
		just set the active project to that you want to build

eMbedded Visual c++:		this will compile for running under WindowsCE 3.0 and
				the arm, mips, sh3 and x86em processors
				just open the workspace file in the root directory of open-wonka (.vcw)
				just set the active project to that you want to build


THE TESTS
=========
All the tests are made to ensure that we have implemented the Oswald API in a good manner.
They have been running on the devices for more than 3 hours without any serious errors.
