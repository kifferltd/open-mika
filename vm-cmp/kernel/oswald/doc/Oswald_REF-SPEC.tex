% When using ACUNIA in your text use the following command

% Ideally, your document should be stored in giza CVS and 
% therefore can be linked to the `Glossary.tex' file in 
% ~giza/component/doc/template directory. 
%\input{../../../doc/template/Glossary}


% \begin{document} statement is in the appropriate LAYOUT file 
% These are maintained in ~giza/component/doc/template/ directroy.
% You must input the appropriate LAYOUT file relatively, removing  
% any LAYOUT files from this directory if you will be working in CVS. 
% For example:
\input{../../../doc/template/Layout-Report} 


%\input{summary}

% If you require a TABLE OF CONTENTS uncomment the following lines:
\setcounter{tocdepth}{5}
\tableofcontents
\newpage



% This is where the majority of your text shall reside, rename it 
% if it is more appropriate:

\input{body}

% If you require an APPENDIX (e.g. with a glossary).
%\appendix

\part*{Appendices} 

\appendix
\input{appendix}


% For the GLOSSARY you must include the ACUNIA `Glossary.tex' file. 
% It is stored in CVS (~giza/component/doc/template/Glossary.tex).
% (included above, below \include{details} line)....
% This file defines all glossary entries as a NEWCOMMAND so that 
% one must COMMENT and/or UNCOMMMENT the necessary NEWCOMMANDS 
% that are specified in `glossary.tex' located in this 
% directory.
