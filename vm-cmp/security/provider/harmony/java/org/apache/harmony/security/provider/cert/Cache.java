/**
 * The caching mechanism designed to speed up the process
 * of Certificates/CRLs generation in the case of their repeated
 * generation.
 *
 * It keeps correspondences between Objects (Certificates or CLRs)
 * and arrays of bytes on the base of which the Objects have been generated,
 * and provides the means to determine whether it contains the object built on
 * the base of particular encoded form or not. If there are such
 * objects they are returned from the cache, if not - newly generated
 * objects can be saved in the cache.<br>
 *
 * The process of Certificate/CRL generation
 * (implemented in <code>X509CertFactoryImpl</code>) is accompanied with
 * prereading of the beginning of encoded form. This prefix is used to determine
 * whether provided form is PEM encoding or not.<br>
 *
 * So the use of the prefix is the first point to (approximately)
 * determine whether object to be generated is in the cache or not.
 *
 * The failure of the predetermination process tells us that there were not
 * object generated from the encoded form with such prefix and we should
 * generate (decode) the object. If predetermination is successful,
 * we conduct the accurate search on the base of whole encoded form. <br>
 *
 * So to speed up the object generation process this caching mechanism provides
 * the following functionality:<br>
 *
 *      1. With having of the beginning of the encoded form (prefix)
 * it is possible to predetermine whether object has already been
 * generated on the base of the encoding with the SIMILAR prefix or not.
 * This process is not computationally expensive and takes a little time.
 * But it prevents us from use of expensive full encoding
 * search in the case of its failure.<br>
 *
 *      2. If predetermination ends with success, the whole encoding
 * form should be provided to make the final answer: whether object has
 * already been generated on the base of this PARTICULAR encoded form or not.
 * If it is so - the cached object is returned from the cache,
 * if not - new object should be generated and saved in the cache.<br>
 *
 * Note: The length of the prefixes of the encoded forms should not be
 * less than correspondence (default value is 28).
