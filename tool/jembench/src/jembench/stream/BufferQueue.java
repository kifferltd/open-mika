// TODOs:
//  Method names are currently quite ambiguous. Consider:
//    empty()  -> isEmpty()   // see also: java.util.Collection
//    full()   -> isFull()
//    cnt()    -> available() // or even size() as in Collection
//    free()   -> capacity()  // or even remainingCapacity()
//
//  For increased familiarity with the J2SE API, also consider:
//    checkedEnq() -> offer()
//    deq()        -> poll()
//
// MS: I don't care too much about those names. It's a very simple
// class with very simple names. At least I know what is meant ;-)
//
//  Do we really need the unchecked enq()?
// If one knows what he/she is doing this is more efficient...
